Purchase Order Accrual:
Imagine you run a company that manufactures electronics, and you've just received a shipment of electronic components from a supplier. 
However, the supplier hasn't sent you the invoice yet, and you can't wait to record the expenses until the invoice arrives. 
So, to accurately reflect your company's financial position, you make a "Purchase Order Accrual."
This Purchase Order Accrual means that even though you haven't received the invoice, you still recognize the expenses and liabilities related to the received goods. 
By doing this, you match the cost of the components to the period in which you actually received and used them in your production process, 
rather than waiting for the invoice to arrive later.

Foreign Currency Revaluation:
Let's say your company operates internationally, and you have transactions in foreign currencies.
For instance, you recently purchased raw materials from a supplier in Japan, and the transaction was denominated in Japanese yen. 
When you initially recorded the transaction in your accounting books, you converted the yen amount to your reporting currency (let's say USD) based on the exchange rate at that time.
However, currency exchange rates fluctuate, and by the time you prepare your financial statements, the exchange rate may have changed.
So, to accurately reflect the current value of your foreign currency assets and liabilities, you perform a "Foreign Currency Revaluation."

During this process, you adjust the value of your yen-denominated transaction to the exchange rate at the reporting date. 
Any resulting gain or loss is then recorded in your income statement. 
This adjustment ensures that changes in currency exchange rates don't distort your company's financial position and 
helps you present a more accurate financial picture to stakeholders.
